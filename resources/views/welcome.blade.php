    <h2>Why you should use RoseWallet:</h2>
    Ethereum and Ethereum wallets itself are not really anonymous, they only
    provide so called pseudonymity, which means as long as no one knows
    which Ethereum addresses you are using, you are anonymous.<br>
    That anonymity is easily destroyed when you deal with some party that
    knows your real identity, for example if you sell or buy Ethereums on an
    exchange.<br>
    And with more and more exchanges and other services following AML and
    KYC policies, its getting really hard to stay anonymous to government
    agencys when dealing with Ethereums.<br>
    RoseWallet helps you break that chain, since its hosted at a Web hidden
    service, and no one knows who we are, we do not have to follow any AML
    and KYC policies, so we cannot be forced to give out any of our users
    information.<br>
    Even if we wanted to, we do not have much information about our users
    since through Web we do not see any ips or other sensitive data.<br>
    RoseWallet mixes all Ethereums, which makes tracing you on the Ethereum blockchain impossible.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Ethereum and RoseWallet, a perfect team</h2>
    When using Ethereum together with Web you are combining the best online
    money with the best encryption and privacy technology available.<br>
    Its simply not possible to know you are not under surveillance when using normal internet websites for managing your Ethereums.<br>
    Only a shared Ethereum Web Wallet hosted as a Web hidden service will provide you maximum anonymity and privacy!<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Free Ethereum Laundry, Ethereum Washing, Ethereum Mixer</h2>
    Launder your Ethereums without any fees, all we charge is the network fee we pay to Ethereums miners.<br>
    For mixing your Ethereums, or washing them, it is best to use a Tor
    hidden service like RoseWallet because all mixers operating a clearnet
    website, including coinfog, are subject to government control.<br>
